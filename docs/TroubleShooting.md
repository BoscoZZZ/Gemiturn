# Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions for common issues encountered when using the Gemiturn system.

## API Integration Issues

### Authentication Failures

**Problem**: Unable to authenticate with the API.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your API key is correct and not expired
2. Check that your JWT token is valid and not expired
3. Ensure you're including the "Bearer" prefix in your Authorization header
4. Confirm that you're using HTTPS for secure endpoints

**Example**:
```bash
# Correct authentication request
curl -X POST https://api.gemiturn.com/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api_key": "your-api-key"}'
```

### Data Retrieval Issues

**Problem**: Cannot retrieve return data from the API.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the return ID exists in your system
2. Check permissions for accessing the specific resource
3. Ensure the correct endpoint URLs are being used
4. Validate query parameters format (especially dates)

## AI Analysis Problems

### Image Analysis Failures

**Problem**: The system fails to analyze return images.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure images are in supported formats (JPG, PNG)
2. Verify image size is under the 10MB limit
3. Check that images are clear and well-lit
4. Confirm that the Google Cloud Vision API is properly configured

### Low Confidence Scores

**Problem**: AI analysis produces low confidence scores.

**Solutions**:
1. Provide higher quality images
2. Include more detailed product descriptions
3. Add multiple images from different angles
4. Verify that the product category is correctly assigned

## Database Issues

### Data Persistence Problems

**Problem**: Data isn't being saved correctly to the database.

**Solutions**:
1. Check database connection settings
2. Verify database user permissions
3. Ensure required fields are provided in requests
4. Examine server logs for database transaction errors

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow database response times.

**Solutions**:
1. Optimize database queries
2. Add appropriate indexes
3. Consider database caching
4. Scale database resources if needed

## Deployment Troubleshooting

### Google Cloud Platform Issues

**Problem**: Services not functioning correctly on GCP.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify service account permissions
2. Check resource allocation and limits
3. Ensure APIs are enabled in the GCP Console
4. Review Cloud Run or App Engine logs for errors

### Environment Configuration

**Problem**: System not picking up environment variables.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify environment variables are correctly set
2. Check for name typos in environment variables
3. Restart services after changing environment variables
4. Ensure secrets are properly configured in your environment
